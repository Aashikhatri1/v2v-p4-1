* Since the user has not provided any information in the previous part of the conversation, all the values in the JSON response are set to "N/A".
* The "Booking ID" field is set to "N/A" because the user has not provided any booking ID.
* The "New check-in date" and "New check-out date" fields are set to "N/A" because the user has not provided any new dates for check-in or check-out.

Note: This response is just an example and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the system you're working with.
