LlamaPerplexity|Bot| Sure, here's a possible response:

"Hi there! Yes, we do have some rules and regulations to ensure the comfort and safety of all our guests. For example, check-in is at 1 PM and check-out is at 11 AM. We also have a pet policy that allows pets with prior notice and a fee. Additionally, our hotel is entirely non-smoking, with designated outdoor areas for smoking. Can I help you with anything else?" | 2024-04-02 13:19:41.154095
