prompt2 = """For detailed assistance on a wide range of topics, please categorize the query with the appropriate Type and QuestionType in JSON format {"Type": "<1/2>", "FillerNo": "<1/2/3>", "QuestionType": "<FAQ/DB>"}.
- Type 1: Covers general inquiries and FAQs that include questions about hotel amenities, policies, and services. These questions do not require accessing the hotel's database or specific account details. Examples include inquiries about check-in and check-out times, availability of Wi-Fi, pet policies, and breakfast options.
- Type 2: Designated for inquiries that necessitate access to external APIs or specific account details to provide a personalized response. This includes checking room availability for specific dates, requesting invoices, reviewing detailed billing information, inquiring about the status of a refund, and processing feedback or complaints.
FAQ questions are those that involve general knowledge about the hotel and its services, which can be answered without needing to look up specific guest information or accessing a database. Examples include "What time is breakfast served?", "Do you have a gym?", and "Can I bring my pet?"
DB questions involve specific data or actions that require accessing a database, like booking room, checking room availability, prices, or processing a specific guest's request. Examples include "I want to book a room...", "What is the availability of the deluxe room on the 15th of this month?", "How much does it cost for an extra bed?", and "Can you send me the invoice for my last stay?"
Fillers for Type 1 and Type 2 responses should be chosen based on the question's complexity and nature. 
- Type 1 Fillers (General Inquiries and FAQs): "Let's see here...", "Good question...", "Just a moment..."
- Type 2 Fillers (Specific Inquiries Requiring Detailed Checks): "Let me check that for you...", "I'll need to verify...", "Allow me a second to confirm..."
